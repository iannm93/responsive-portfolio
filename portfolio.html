                            <p class="card-text white times2 times2"> Are You Still Watching is a web program that
                                shows users where their favorite television shows and movies can be streamed, and gives
                                the user a direct link to their streaming service. This application utilizes 3 different
                                APIs; Utelly, OMDB, and YouTube to give users information such as: the plot of the
                                movie/show, when the movie/show was released, the movie/show's poster, the IMDB ratings,
                                and
                                returns an embeddded trailer from YouTube. My reason for creating this application was
                                to help users find the movies and shows they're interested in watching without having to
                                go through the multiple steps that sometimes entails. Are You Still Watching will lead
                                you right to the action!

                            <p class="card-text white times2">This is a web application that allows a user to create an
                                account and store future/previous vacations in their wishlists. After the user logs in,
                                there is a search bar in which they can type their desired destination and they'll be
                                returned with an image from that location and a brief summary of the area. The user can
                                then add it to their "wishlist" or to their "visited". The google maps/google places
                                API's were both used to get the city/country and other location data associated with the
                                user search. This application is still in progress and we have a lot of ideas for future
                                development, such as rendering the user's wishlist/visited destinations as a color-coded
                                marker on our map. </p>

                            <p class="card-text white times2"> Dunk or Flunk is an app designed using JavaScript and
                                React to test a user's knowledge of NBA statistics. After the user creates an account at
                                the log in page, they're redirected to a quiz page where they are presented with two
                                randomized players and a randomized question related to basketball statistics, i.e, "who
                                has the better field goal percentage" or "who has more assits per game." When the user
                                clicks the correct headshot corresponding with the correct statistic, they got a point.
                                Conversely, if they click the wrong answer, they get a brick. Three bricks and you go
                                home! The API used for this app is called BallDontLie, and it's a free API that allows
                                users to query statistics for any players they want in the NBA. This app is defintiely
                                still in progress, we plan to add more sports to the game and a few more exciting
                                things. </p>
